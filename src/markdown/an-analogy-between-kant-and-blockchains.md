title: An analogy between Kantian epistemology and blockchains
---

Let’s consider a proposition.

    Objectivity is the universality of receptive structured subjectivity.

Although I’m no Kant scholar,  I feel this proposition captures the achievement of the philosopher’s transcendental idealism. To explain key structures of experience (such as cause-effect relations), Kant pointed to the human mind rather than the external world. He argued that there are appearances and that the mind determines, at least partially, how these appearances appear. Despite his focus on the subjective, Kant found a way to explain objectivity. He more or less argued that objectivity is the convergence of many minds. In other words, because each human has the same mental faculties—that is, because each human’s experience is structured the same way—all humans have knowledge of the same empirical world. For Kant, we do not obtain objective knowledge via coming into contact with the things in themselves, the things as they are independent of our experience. Instead, _all of us_ come into contact with things _only as we experience them_. 

In other words, objectivity is the universality of receptive structured subjectivity.

It’s easier to appreciate the beauty of Kant’s thought when considering the details of his system, but let’s turn our appreciation towards blockchains for a little bit—and keep Kant in mind.

What is a blockchain? I like to think of a blockchain as being comprised of three elements: the protocol, the network, and the state. The protocol defines what kinds of data a node can handle and how the node handles that data (i.e., how it receives, stores, and transmits the data). The network is simply the collection of connected machines running the protocol. And the state is the intersection (if I may use set terminology) of the stores of the machines on the network; it is the record that emerges from the interaction of the nodes on the network. 

In a sentence, a blockchain is a network of nodes, each of which keeps track of a state and runs a protocol whereby it generates, stores, and receives data affecting the state.

At an extremely high level of abstraction, Kant’s epistemology is identical to a blockchain system. Both systems answer (within their domain) the question, What is objective truth? Or what mechanisms are responsible for objective truth?

We can see the analogy between these two systems when we use a certain vocabulary to consider blockchains. By “certain vocabulary,” I mean the vocabulary of our thematic proposition: Objectivity is the universality of receptive structured subjectivity.

We could work forwards through this proposition, defining objectivity first and subjectivity last. But that would be trying to start at the destination since our goal is to understand “objective.” Let’s start with subjectivity.

**Subjectivity**. Each node in a blockchain is a subject. A state is said to be subjectively true if any node on the network recognizes it as true.  Just like the private thoughts and feelings of a single person are subjective, the “thoughts and feelings” (i.e., states) of a single node are subjective.

**Structured**. Each node running the blockchain protocol is, by virtue of running a protocol, structured. The protocol defines both how a node interacts with other nodes and what the node can recognize as valid or true. For example, if a node running the bitcoin protocol receives a message that is not formatted as a bitcoin transaction, the node will reject the message. To the bitcoin node, the message could be anything from spam to a nation’s nuclear codes—the node doesn’t care. Since the message wasn’t formatted correctly, the data is fundamentally meaningless, senseless, invalid.  Whatever the data corresponded to in the “real world” is not real to the bitcoin node.

**Receptive**. We should not take for granted that nodes on a blockchain network are receptive to data from other nodes. This receptivity is a condition for state changes. The Kantian analogue to data is phenomena, appearances. Just like human minds are receptive to appearances, nodes on a network are receptive to data.

**Universal**. Note that every node on a blockchain network runs the same protocol.  This is the universality of structured subjectivity. Not only does one node operate according to a certain ruleset, but every node it communicates with operates according to the same ruleset. 

**Objectivity**. Objectivity, then, is nothing less than the state common to all (or the majority of) the nodes on the network. Because every node runs the same protocol and receives similar data, a single state emerges from the interaction of these nodes. 

### Final Thoughts
It might be valuable to introduce a few more terms to our philosophy-inspired blockchain vocabulary.

A state is _objectively true_ when the majority of nodes recognize it as such. A message is _meaningful_  when it accords with the transaction format. A transaction can be said to have _weak truth_ when it is valid (i.e., when both the transaction accords with the transaction format and, in the case of cryptocurrencies, its sender has enough funds to cover the transaction). A transaction can be said to have _strong truth_ once it is on a block on the blockchain and the block has enough confirmations (i.e., once the transaction is reversable only by a hard fork). 

In sum, there exists an analogy between blockchain systems and Kant’s epistemology. The analogy relates to how truth and knowledge are reached/defined. Kant’s epistemology articulates and blockchains implement systems in which objectivity is reached via the universality of receptive structured subjectivity.
