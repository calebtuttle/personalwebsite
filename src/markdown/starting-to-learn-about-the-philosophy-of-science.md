title: I'm starting to learn about the philosophy of science

<!-- There will likely be more entries of this sort. Maybe make the title more broad and add numbers (e.g., "Notes on the philosophy of science 1"). -->

I have begun to think and read about DeSci and the philosophy of science...

And it seems to me that scientific knowledge has many languages/aspects/formulations. Scientists communicate with natural language, mathematics, logic, the formalizations of chemistry (for example), data, algorithms, machine learning models (which seem to be algorithms partly defined by an initializing set of data), and probably other devices. 

This is interesting to me because big data and big models are extremely recent and might not typically be thought of as tools for communication, even though data is (in some sense) information and ML models are information processors, with information and information processing being essential to communication.

If big data and big models are means of communication or ways to formulate knowledge, it seems like we should (a) be data-and-model-literate and (b) treat these things with perhaps as much reverence as books. In a democratic and liberal (read "free") society, we ought to have libraries for data and models. To the extent that knowledge is power and that most citizens are illiterate in this domain, the small segment of society which _is_ literate in this way has exlusive access to the power derived from the certain kinds of knowledge made possible by big data and big ML models.

(I started going down a rabbit whole of political thought, sorry. I just want to focus on the nature of knowledge.)

Before computers, knowledge took the form of natural language, mathematics, etc., but did not take the form of big data (for the most part, not including the use of things like the [Hollerith Machine](https://www.census.gov/history/www/innovations/technology/the_hollerith_tabulator.html)) or big ML models. 

To illustrate, consider the following elementary claim: Water, H<sub>2</sub>O, transitions from liquid to gas at the temperature 100&deg; Celsius. This simple statement includes a formal language for chemical formulas (in "H<sub>2</sub>O"), the use of a number (100&deg; Celsius) which presupposes at the very least the ability to do the basic math of counting to know the difference between 100 and not-100, and natural language.

Knowledge that comes in the form of big data and big ML models is harder to descipher. We haven't--or most of us haven't--developed the ability to communicate with these tools. We know some basic statistics, like the average, but only a very, very small percent of the human species is able to understand what these data and models are capable of saying. 

Anyway, a [decentralized commons](https://pulse.opsci.io/rich-in-data-poor-in-wisdom-science-needs-a-decentralized-data-commons-98c7ffdb56a1) and marketplace for "knowledge assets" such as data and algorithms might help.
