title: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs as a utility function
---

Dear reader, I hardly know what I'm talking about. These notes touch on utility functions, but I have only taken intro economics classes. I probably make some mistakes, but I'm making these notes public in part because I want my confusions to be pointed out. So if you have criticisms, reading suggestions, or other feedback, please reach out to [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/calebtuttle9).

## Modeling needs
Every human has needs.

Let our example human have three needs:
- Food
- Sleep
- Social connection

The motivational pull of each need can be represented as a function of time. Let 0 be no motivational pull and 1 be an unbearably strong motivational pull. As we spend time without the need being met, the strength of the pull approaches 1. Once the need is satiated, the motivational pull drops toward 0. In this model, the motivational pull (or "drive") of every need looks like the sleep drive represented in the following graph.

For our example human, their food need, sleep need, and social-connection need all resemble the above graph. After eating until I'm satiated, I do not want food. Hunger then increases as I spend more time without eating. The same is true with social connection. Spending a lot of time alone increases the need for social connection, but as I spend quality time with others, the need for social connection diminishes until I wish to be alone again. In this way, both hunger and loneliness resemble sleepiness; and their satiation resembles sleep.

The "sleep drive" graph is obviously an approximation, a simplification. The effects of diet, exercise, stress, eating schedule, etc. on hunger are well documented. By analogy, then, it seems plausible that noise can be injected into the graphs of our other needs. Nonetheless, the basic drive remains the same. We can feel at least somewhat confident in this because a person would likely die if these needs aren't met.

## Maslow, the "sleep drive" graph, and utility
If all of our needs have this basic structure, we can construct a basic picture of the human using Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. A human has a constellation of needs. In the model described above (which--I must note--has not undergone criticism and so likely overlooks important intricacies), the primary determinant of the shape of a need graph is the amount of time the human has spent without the need being (partially or wholly) met. If this holds, and if needs are even somewhat hierarchical, and if we have data about when a need was last met, we can determine the need with the most motivational pull at a given point in time.

(The conditionals are obviously important and likely don't hold. Psychology might, however, have enough theory and data to determine how these graphs are distorted by various influences. For example, we all know social media and gmail are designed to give us small "dopamine hits" which can keep us from, for example, sleeping when we need sleep. If this kind of distortion can be modeled, we can continue with our theory here.)

Before I try to link the "sleep drive" graph to utility as it's studied in economics, I note that my goal with this idea is not to explain the supply and demand curves or any other group phenomena. Rather, my goal is, first, to help an individual identify and pursue their needs and, second, to better predict the behavior of individuals.

Now on to needs and utility...

One person's utility cannot be compared to another person's utility. If our model here is true for every human insofar as they are human, then our model can outline something like a needs-based utility function that belongs to every human. Instead of a utility function being only a preference ordering over a set of goods and services, it could be a sort of function of functions of time (i.e., a function of needs, each of which is a function of time), or it could be a preference ordering over a set of needs. Nested within this preference ordering over a set of needs could be a preference ordering over a set of goods and services, or perhaps the "motivational pull" of a need could give different weights to different preferences at different times. The rationale here is that needs might be more fundamental than just any specific preference and might guide more specific preferences--whether this is useful or not, I have no clue.
