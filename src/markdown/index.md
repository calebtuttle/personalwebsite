title: Notes
---

These are just notes. Sometimes I think thoughts, don't have time to develop them, but need an outlet to prevent them from nagging me. This is that outlet. I've made these public, so they are more than the scratching of a psychological itch. Their secondary purpose (which very well might never be fulfilled) is to potentially offer a novel point of view. In other words, if someone were to read one of these entries and quietly think, "Hm, interesting," these notes can be considered a success, in the secondary sense.
