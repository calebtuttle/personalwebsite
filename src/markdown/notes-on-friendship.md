title: Notes on friendship

Dear reader, I hope these ideas strike you as weird. If you find them weird (in a good or bad way), feel free to reach out to [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/calebtuttle9).

## Introduction
It seems [some people are thinking about friendship.](#people-whose-thoughts-on-friendship-have-stuck-out-to-me) The rise of "social" media has mainly shown us what friendship _is not_. In doing so, it has simultaneously highlighted our need for friendship and reduced the search space for the nature of friendship. I think we should begin considering _the problem of friendship_. That is, what is friendship? A better understanding of friendship might lead to technologies that better facilitate friendship. Tacit in the design of current social media platforms is a poor model of friendship. Right now, using social media is a little like installing a new operating system as a non-technical user. The process is time consuming, and we are given too many options about things we don't understand. We have access to the tools we need, but we don't know how to use them. We need a social media platform whose design embodies a deep understanding of the nature of friendship.

I don't have such a platform or such an understanding of friendship. But this problem is important, so I've taken a stab at approaching a mode of thinking which might help us eventually reach these two goals. We could call it a _transactionist_ view of friendship. It is inspired by social contract theory (though I couldn't find much work on the social contracts of friendship; and for any philosophy students, I'm not directly inspired by Dewey's notion of "transaction" because I've never read Dewey). The next section (on technology) suggests some applications of this view, and the section titled "Numbered reflections" covers some initial exposition of this view.

## Technological reflections
Assume we desire to create a social media platform that truly facilitates friendship. If we assume propositions 1.0 and 2.0 (below), and if we assume all _good_ friendship arises out of _easy_ friendship, then our goal _must_ include facilitation of easy friendship.

How might we facilitate easy friendship? First, we must remove the information-processing burden that current social media apps place on users. We require minimal interaction with the app itself--just like a user of a modern PC requires minimal interaction with configuration files. To accomplish minimal interaction, we must know what produces easy friendship without subjecting the user to a barrage of survey questions. This will require an amount of data that current social media platforms might not even have. I think obtaining this data might, however, be possible. For example, we could combine EEG data with internet activity with data from wearables. This data would of course be controlled entirely by the user, so our ability to service the user would be limited by how much data the user provides. From here, it becomes the matching problem that dating apps are in the business of solving. 

## Numbered reflections
(Forgive me. These reflections aren't informed.)

(Nov. 25, 2021 EDIT: I just discovered [social exchange theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exchange_theory).)
(Dec. 2, 2021 EDIT: Let's defer to the social exchange theorists on the matters discussed in this section. I'm still leaving this here, though, for my future self.)

What follows uses the numbering system from Ludwig Wittgenstein's _Tractatus Logico Philosophicus_ (where 1.1 is an elaboration on 1.0, and 1.11 is an elaboration on 1.1).

1.0 - All friendship is transactional.

1.1 - That is, one's relationship with a friend is an ongoing exchange. 

1.2 - This is most apparent when the transactional agreement is broken (just like aspects of [Hiedegger's hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology#Ready-to-hand) reveal themselves when the hammer breaks).

1.21 - For example, we see this all the time in romantic relationships, where infatuation causes some of the faculties of the parties involved to be temporarily disfunctional. When such faculties regain functionality, partners often become disenchanted with each other, and admiration dwindles.

1.22 - When the exchanges stay within the bounds of the transactional agreement, the friends have no reason to consider the agreement as such.

2.0 - In an *easy friendship*, each party expects to give what the other expects to receive. The easiest friendships are the most predictable. 

2.1 - This matching of expectations is often tacit. You and your friend happen to "get along," so you continue in your friendship. 

2.11 - There are, however, cultural ways of matching these expectations. Almost all institutions provide such a service, even if it is a very poor one. For example, a member of a book club expects certain things from her friends in the club, namely, a regular conversation about the books they read. This is an obvious example, but something similar happens at almost every location on the social map. The people at the gym are, potentially, your friends with respect to weight lifting. Your classmates are potentially your friends with respect to the class material. Depending on the context, different kinds of expectations are available. It is ok to expect a spot from a gym-friend (and to provide a spot to a gym-friend), but the spotting-expectation is a distant one for book-club-friends.

2.2 - This matching of expectations also often means the relationship takes relatively little time to develop and relatively little effort to maintain.

2.21 - The qualification "relatively" is important. Both friends, for example, might be difficult people and be living through difficult circumstances. Such a friendship can be described as easy because Friend A is superior to Friend B's potential friends at continually anticipating and meeting Friend B's expectations (and so is Friend B superior to Friend A's potential friends).

3.0 - The "transactions" of friendship include much more than just activities in which the friends are focused, in part or whole, on each other.

3.1 - Some activities of friendship include being subsumed into an activity with another person, having little to no thought about the person's thoughts or feelings. The most notable of these transactions include many people. Subjectively, it even feels as though the transaction is between oneself and some indeterminate, myseterous, beautiful (or terrifying), transcendent whole.

3.11 - For example, when we play team sports, our teammates are our friends. I *get* something from participating in the team sport. A better example: As I sing at a concert, my individual voice is lost in a chorus of thousands of other voices where euphoria comes over me. Or: While in the stands of a football stadium, I cheer on my team, raising my voice with the crowd, moving my arms in a "wave" that flows through the entire stadium. Why do we do these things--*pursue* these things--if we do not get something from them--if we do not derive value from them?

3.2 - If such a "transaction" is between more than two parties, who is exchanging what? I contend that even though the transaction feels as though it is between me and "the group," there is an individual transaction between me and every other person in the group. The exchange of value is, however, negligible when only one person engages in the desired behavior (i.e., when only one person "cooperates"). The effects of these transactions is felt in me only after sufficiently many people cooperate.

3.21 - But why say there is a transaction at all if it is not felt until a certain threshold is met? Isn't that postulating entities without necessity? If we are going to explain the *initial* occurrence of this cooperation-seeking behavior (e.g., a wave of arms in a stadium), with whom is the initiator transacting? If he is not transacting with another indiviudal person, he must be transacting with the group as such or the group's activity (i.e., the wave) as such, but this feels more like posulating unnecessary entities than only allowing transactions between individual human beings.
